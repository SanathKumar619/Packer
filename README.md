# Packer Code

* Packer is an open-source tool designed for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. Developed by HashiCorp, Packer allows developers and system administrators to automate the process of building, provisioning, and deploying machine images for various virtualization and cloud platforms.

* The primary goal of Packer is to provide a consistent and repeatable way to create machine images, ensuring that the environments across development, testing, and production remain consistent. Packer supports a wide range of platforms, including virtualization technologies like VMware, Hyper-V, and VirtualBox, as well as cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and many others.

* Users define the machine image configuration using a JSON file or HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). Packer then uses this configuration to automate the installation of software, configuration settings, and any other necessary components. The result is a machine image that can be used across different environments, reducing the chances of inconsistencies and simplifying the deployment process.

* By integrating Packer into the development and deployment workflows, organizations can achieve faster and more reliable infrastructure provisioning, leading to improved scalability, manageability, and consistency in their IT environments. 

* In this packer i have created my own image.
